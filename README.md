# DSA5204-Project-Time-Series-Imaging

In this project, we explore the potential of combining time-series imaging with deep learning architectures to enhance the modeling of temporal dependencies in time-series data. We utilize the Long and Short Term Time Series Network (LSTNet) as our primary deep learning architecture, specifically designed for time series forecasting applications. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs), an innovative method for encoding time series data as images while preserving temporal dependencies, which allows us to harness the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature recognition in time-series tasks. We extend this combined approach to time series forecasting, comparing the performance of LSTNet with GAFs against the primary LSTNet model for both 1-step and recursive forecasting methodologies.
